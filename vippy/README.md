Python implementation of the Admissible Velocity Propagation algorithm
introduced in [Pham et al., RSS
2013](http://www.normalesup.org/~pham/docs/kinodynamic.pdf)

**This code is outdated and not maintained. See
[TOPP](https://github.com/quangounet/TOPP) for a fast and stable C++
implementation.**

The core algorithm for time-optimal path parameterization under second-order
limits is based on the works of Bobrow, Dubowsky, Johanni, Pfeiffer, Slotine,
Shiller, Pham, etc. See [Pham, Asian-MMS
2012](http://www.normalesup.org/~pham/docs/shortcuts.pdf) for details.
